# Trucks-And-Bridges
This is a final project in the data structures course.
In this project we were asked to build a data structure containing roads and bridges so that each bridge has a different height. Every road has several bridges.
Given the height of the truck, the program finds the road where the truck can pass without getting stuck.
Each method is performed with the required efficiency.
Data structure I used: Maximum Heap, lists and arrays.
The project was written in C++ language.
*The program does not use STL and all the data structures were written by me.
